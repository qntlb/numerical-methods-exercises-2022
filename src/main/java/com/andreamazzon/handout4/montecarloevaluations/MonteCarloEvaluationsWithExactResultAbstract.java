/**
 * This is an abstract class inheriting from MonteCarloEvaluationsAbstract, so
 * also implementing the interface MonteCarloEvaluationsInterface. Therefore, it
 * provides the implementation of methods that can be called in order to get the
 * vector of several Monte-Carlo approximations of a given quantity, the average
 * and the standard deviation of the vector, as well as its minimum and maximum
 * value and an histogram of its elements. Moreover, here we suppose that we
 * already know the exact value of the quantity we approximate by Monte-Carlo.
 * So we experiment on the quality of our approximation by getting the vector of
 * the absolute errors and the average of the vector. This is done by the
 * methods double[] getAbsoluteErrorsOfComputations() and double
 * getAverageAbsoluteError(), respectively. Note that all the methods are based
 * on the protected double[] field monteCarloComputations, inherited from
 * MonteCarloExperiments, that hosts all the elements of the vector. This vector
 * is initialized and filled by the protected abstract void method
 * generateMonteCarloComputations(), also inherited from MonteCarloExperiments,
 * whose implementation depends on the kind of Monte-Carlo approximation
 * considered.
